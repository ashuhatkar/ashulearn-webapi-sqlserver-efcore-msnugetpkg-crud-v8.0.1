## BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

> develop: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against the develop branch to be considered**. This branch is developed using .NET 8

The main branch contains the old code base and will get obsolete in the future. So it's recommended to refer to different tags to avoid any confusion.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR against them!

Thanks!
